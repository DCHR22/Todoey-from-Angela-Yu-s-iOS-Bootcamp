This project was taken from the Angela Yu's iOS App Development Online Bootcamp. 
I wanted to revisit it and comment all of it to fully understand how we can use NSUserDefaults as a data persistance method. 
Reason why I uploaded at this stage is because in further steps NSUD is replaced by CoreData and SQLite. This is intended to be an study resource only.
